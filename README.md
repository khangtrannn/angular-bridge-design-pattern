## How does bridge pattern apply in Angular Forms
What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is a high-level control layer for some entities. And this high-level class isn't supposed to do any real work on its own. It should delegate the work to the implementation layer

Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level module should not depend on low level module, both should depend on abstraction
